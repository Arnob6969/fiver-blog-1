    <p>Working with a boss is just a natural part of life. Whether you work a typical 9-5 desk job reporting to a manager, or you work as a freelancer reporting to clients, it’s important to understand how to work effectively with a boss.
    </p>
    <p>Today, we’ll help you identify different kinds of bosses and how to work with the type of boss you have (or might have in the future).</p>
    <h3>Boss Type #1: The Workaholic</h3>
    <p>The key to keeping up with a workaholic boss is finding the perfect work-life balance. You can achieve that by setting clear boundaries at work and at home so the two don't interfere with one another in a detrimental way. Make sure to take natural breaks such as evenings, weekends, and holidays to rejuvenate, and then give 110% when you're at the office with your boss.</p>
    <h3>Boss Type #2: The Traditionalist</h3>
    <p>If your boss tends to do things the way they’ve always been done, you might be working for a traditionalist boss.</p>
    <p>While you may need to work harder and more tactfully to think outside the box, a traditionalist boss provides a very secure work environment where few risks are taken.</p>
